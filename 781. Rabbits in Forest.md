# 781. Rabbits in Forest

There is a forest with an unknown number of rabbits. 

We asked n rabbits "How many rabbits have the same color as you?" 

and collected the answers in an integer array answers where answers[i] is the answer of the ith rabbit.

Given the array answers, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numRabbits(vector<int>& answers) {
        unordered_map<int,int> rabbit_map;
        int res = 0;

        for(auto ans : answers){
            rabbit_map[ans+1]++;
        }

        for(auto[key,val] : rabbit_map){
            int count = (int) ceil((double)val/key);
            res += (count * key);
        }   
        return res;
    }
};
```
