# 2145. Count the Hidden Sequences

You are given a 0-indexed array of n integers differences, 

which describes the differences between each pair of consecutive integers of a hidden sequence of length (n + 1). More formally, 

call the hidden sequence hidden, then we have that differences[i] = hidden[i + 1] - hidden[i].

You are further given two integers lower and upper that describe the inclusive range of values [lower, upper] that the hidden sequence can contain.

For example, given differences = [1, -3, 4], lower = 1, upper = 6, the hidden sequence is a sequence of length 4 whose elements are in between 1 and 6 (inclusive).
[3, 4, 1, 5] and [4, 5, 2, 6] are possible hidden sequences.
[5, 6, 3, 7] is not possible since it contains an element greater than 6.
[1, 2, 3, 4] is not possible since the differences are not correct.
Return the number of possible hidden sequences there are. If there are no possible sequences, return 0.

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int numberOfArrays(vector<int>& differences, int lower, int upper) {
        int start = lower , end = lower;
        long long curr = 0;

        for(auto dif : differences){
            curr += dif;
            if(lower+curr > upper || upper-curr < lower){
                return 0;
            }

            if(curr > 0){
                while(end >= start && end + curr > upper){
                    end--;
                }
            }else{
                while(end >= start && start + curr < lower){
                    start++;
                }
            }  
        }
        return end - start + 1;
    }

};
```
